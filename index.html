        <h2>1.Show implementation of CSS transitions.</h2>
        <p>
            The transition-property specifies the CSS properties to which you want the transition effect.
            Only these CSS properties are animated.
        </p>

        <h2>2.Show implementation of CSS transform.</h2>
        <p>
            CSS transforms are a collection of functions that allow to shape elements in particular ways:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>translate:</b> moves the element along up to 3 axis (x, y and z)</li>
            <li><b>rotate:</b> moves the element around a central point.</li>
            <li><b>scale:</b> resizes the element</li>
            <li><b>skew:</b> distorts the element</li>
        </ul>
        <b>translate</b> <br>  <br>
        <div class="translate"></div> <br>
        <b>rotate</b>
        <div class="rotate"></div> 
        <b>scale</b> <br> <br> <br> <br>
        <div class="scale"></div> <br> <br><br>
        <b>skew</b> <br> <br> <br>
        <div class="skew"></div> <br>

        <h2>3.Show implementation of Grid.</h2>
    <div class="container">
        <div class="item item1">1</div>
        <div class="item item2">2</div>
        <div class="item item3">3</div>
        <div class="item item4">4</div>
        <div class="item item5">5</div>

        <h2>4.What are CSS Combinators?</h2>
        <p>
            Combinators combine the selectors to provide them a useful relationship and the position of content in 
            the document. This comes in handy when you want to style certain elements all at once rather than styling
            elements individually. CSS combinator selectors are as follows.
        </p>
        <ol type="1">
            <li>Descendant Selector (space)</li>
            <li>Child Selector (>)</li>
            <li>Adjacent Sibling Selector (+)</li>
            <li>General Sibling Selector (~)</li>
        </ol>
        <b>Descendant Selector :</b> The descendant selector matches all elements that are descendants of a specified
           element.
        <div class="descendant">
            <h2>Hello World!</h2>
            <p>I am child paragraph</p>
            <p>I am child paragraph</p>
        </div>
        <b>Child Selector :</b>The child selector will only affect elements under a direct parent. A good way to 
        remember this is that a child will only listen to its direct parents.
        <div class="child">
            <h2>This heading is a direct child of the div tag.</h2>
            <p>So is this paragraph tag.</p>
            <button>
                <p>This paragraph tag is NOT a direct child of the first div</p>
            </button>
            <p>This paragraph tag is also a child of the div tag</p>
        </div>
        <b>Adjacent Sibling Selector :</b>To use the adjacent sibling selector in your CSS stylesheet, you simply 
        need the plus (+) sign. The adjacent sibling selector is used to select an element that is directly after 
        another specific element.
        <div class="adjacent">
            <h2>This is a H2 tag.</h2>
            <p>This p tag immediately follows the heading.</p>
            <button>
                <p>This p tag is NOT immediately following a H2 tag.</p>
            </button>
            <h2 class="h2">Howdy! This is another H2 tag.</h2>
            <p>This p tag is after another H2 tag and gets formatted.</p>
        </div>
        <b>General Sibling Selectors :</b>The general sibling selector follows through on all elements under the 
        targeted HTML element selected. This means that if another element tag interrupts the direct adjacent flow, 
        the style rules can still follow through.
        <div class="general">
            <h2>I am heading tag!</h2>
            <p>I am paragraph tag 1.</p>
            <button class="button">
                <p>I am a paragraph tag inside a button!</p>
            </button>
            <p>I am paragraph tag 2.</p>
            <p>I am paragraph tag 3.</p>
            <h3>I am another heading tag!</h3>
            <p>I am paragraph tag 4.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>5.What are CSS Pseudo Selectors?</h2>
        <p>
            CSS pseudo-classes are used to add styles to selectors, but only when those selectors meet certain 
            conditions. A pseudo class is expressed by adding a colon (:) after a selector in CSS, followed by a 
            pseudo-class such as "hover", "focus", or "active",
        </p>
        <table>
            <tr>
                <th>:active</th>
                <td>It is used to add style to an active element.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <th>:hover</th>
                <td>It adds special effects to an element when the user moves the mouse pointer over the element.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <th>:link</th>
                <td>It adds style to the unvisited link.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <th>:visited</th>
                <td>It adds style to a visited link.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <th>:lang</th>
                <td>It is used to define a language to use in a specified element.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <th>:focus</th>
                <td>It selects the element which is focused by the user currently.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <th>:first-child</th>
                <td>It adds special effects to an element, which is the first child of another element.</td>
            </tr>
        </table>
